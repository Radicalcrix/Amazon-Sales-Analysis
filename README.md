In this project, I have performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Amazon's sales data for the year 2019. This repository contains the code, data, and documentation related to the analysis.


## Approach

- Data Collection : Imported data from various datasets available in the project and combining them into a single CSV file using Pandas library.

- Data Cleaning : Removed missing values and created new features as per insights.

- Data Preprocessing : Modified the structure of data in order to make it more understandable and suitable and convenient for statistical analysis.

- Data Analysis : The dataset was analysed using Pandas, Numpy,and Matplotlib.

- Data Visualization : Plotted graphs to get insights about dependent and independent variables.
